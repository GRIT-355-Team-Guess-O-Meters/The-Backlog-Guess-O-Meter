**The Backlog Guest-o-mator**
=============================


----------


This product will be used at conferences as a way to engage an audience in a game/exercise in guestimation forecasting with instant feedback. It is part of a discussion on "The Wisdom of Crowds" as a tool for forecasting and estimating how much work is remaining in a backlog. The idea being that there may be an alternative to relative estimation and planning poker that is better suited to larger agile projects.

**Administrator's Back End**
----------------------------

As a survey administrator, I am able to login to a system where I am presented with a control panel and dashboard. The functions I would need to do here are:

- Create a new survey and generate a unique URL that I can provide to session participants 
- Run a survey with a pleasant message, image and a URL (that was generated when creating the survey). Ideally, the url would be in the form of a QR Code. 
- Get and share the results of the survey, as aggregated data. 
- Have historical access to all the surveys.

**Front End**
-------------

As a participant of a survey, I will use my smart phone to recognize the QR Code being displayed at the front of the room which will cause my phone to open a web page in my phone's browser. This web page will have three input fields :- Guess 1 (numeric), Guess 2 (numeric) and email address (alphanumeric). After these fields is a submit button. The button is disabled until both guess one and two have been filled in. (The email address field is optional.)
